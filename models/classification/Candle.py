'''
A final compiled model that is used to classify RC stars from APOGEE red giants

Classifies by regressing stars into Teff-log(g) space, then applying a cut to the theoretical area of red clump stars
Anything outside is considered to be a not RC star (often times, a RGB in the case of APOGEE data sets)

Then runs a 2 hidden layer neural network on the stars inside the cut
